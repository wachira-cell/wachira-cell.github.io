    Research is the backbone of a developed economy. It fuels innovation, which in turn generates
    transformative ideas that drive economic growth, productivity, and global competitiveness.
    Countries that invest consistently in research tend to develop stronger industries, more resilient
    economies, and better solutions to emerging challenges.

    The capacity for ideation within a society is closely linked to the quality of education offered
    in its universities. Higher education institutions are not only centers for knowledge transmission
    but also spaces where critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills are cultivated.
    Through research-based learning, universities empower individuals to question existing systems,
    explore new possibilities, and translate theory into practice.

    Across the world, university researchers have been at the forefront of addressing pressing social,
    economic, and technological challenges. From advancements in healthcare and engineering to
    innovations in agriculture, finance, and public policy, academic research plays a central role in
    shaping sustainable development. Strengthening research ecosystems within universities is therefore
    not a luxury, but a necessity for any country seeking long-term economic progress and
    innovation-led growth.
